# Flask-basic-Register-Login

As a part of on going Test project.(Online bookstore)
Flask webapp.
This app uses Flask framework for back end handling, and html, bootstrap for front end.
The register / login form built by raw HTML and data checking system is built manualy with Sqlite queries.
The database part built by Sqlite but later on ill chenge it to Postgresql and i might use Flask SQLAlchemy as relational mapper.
Code will be refactored as many times as needed.
